  "global_prompt": "Rock Paper Scissors is a two-player hand game where players use hand signals to represent three possible outcomes: rock, paper, or scissors. \n\nThe rules of the game are simple:\n\n1. Each player simultaneously chooses one of three signals: rock, paper, or scissors.\n\n2. The outcome of the game is determined by the following rules:\n* Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors)\n* Scissors beat paper (scissors cut paper)\n* Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)\n* If both players choose the same hand signal, the game is a tie, and the players play again.\n\n3. The winner of each round is determined by comparing the chosen signals. The first player to win 2 rounds wins the game.",

Find the LAST message from Player 1 and the LAST message from Player 2.\n\n## STEP 2: State what you found\nWrite: \"This round: Player 1 played [move], Player 2 played [move]\"\n\n## STEP 3: Apply the rules EXACTLY\nThe rules are:\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper  \n- paper beats rock\n- same move = tie\n\nDetermine the winner using ONLY these rules.\n\n## STEP 4: Count wins from scratch\nGo through ALL previous rounds in the conversation and count how many times each player has won (not tied). Keep a running total.\n\n## STEP 5: Output in this EXACT format\nThis round: Player 1 played [X], Player 2 played [Y]\nRound winner: [Player 1/Player 2/Tie]\nTotal wins so far: Player 1 = [number], Player 2 = [number]\n\nIf either player now has 2 total wins, add:\nGAME OVER! [Player X] wins the match!\n\n## CRITICAL REMINDERS:\n- rock beats scissors (NOT the other way around)\n- scissors beats paper (NOT the other way around)  \n- paper beats rock (NOT the other way around)\n- Only count actual wins, ignore ties\n- Count ALL wins from the entire conversation history each time",
